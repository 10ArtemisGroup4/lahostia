   <h1>Development Among Gloom</h1>

<p> In a world full of diseases, COVID-19 impacts the overall status of the world. In which bothers everyone, even in every aspects of workplace, home and the spread of numerous cancellations towards the busy activity of circulation. School is one of the most affected institutions that result a solid reactions for our agencies, especially DepEd, to create back-up solutions that'll conquer the foremost alignment of the sudden change within our educational environment. Therefore, here I am, believed to pursue that 2 weeks suspension will be the ease for my longing struggles within my last Grade 7 life. Conferred that the 2 weeks suspension is a blessing, but outturns to be not. It constructs a sequel of a negative condition, in which compacts everyone to be under the complexity of hardship. That is where Pandemic start. A 2 year reign of COVID-19 ambience, in which conclude to validate the essence of despair along families who works daily for their life basis and the public services that have lost their privilege on doing their purpose, in a manner of prohibiting people to interact with each other, declared by the Government's protocol. You may wonder, what did the Pandemic do to my routine? Does it impact a change of lifestyle? Therefore, let's confer the activities I've done in my life, in the midst of the Pandemic. First of all, Pandemic doesn't just provide a proven essence of destruction towards my life, it actually gathers all the idea of what family really is. But it actually change the way how I see myself giving the credence that i should be better for allocating myself towards the standard. How do I execute my daily basis? First, I always wake up late, for an approximate time of 9 hours sleep, as scheduled of 11 pm sleep-call and an 8 am wake up call. This is where my routine starts. Even with how late I am, I always start my day with a productive view. I always do the chores that are kept on hold to my abilities, valuing that I must finish the tasks associated with the given management. After that, I interact with the things I love! Like watching movies, reading informational books, and playing with my instrument that triggers my mates with such loudness I produce! With that said, I never forget to implicate what the Pandemic purposely serve, that is to keep the safety and prevention on, thinking that I always cooperate with the disinfection of my community, and fully accept the "ayuda" that our govern policy willingly give. My routine circulates with cleaning, hobbies, and disinfection. One thing I love with Pandemic is that it helps me realize what I am lacking, and that is the love of my family. But thus, it never solves my contrasting aspect of view which is the beauty standards. This values more of my awakening, hence believing that I will keep on pursuing what is proven to be beautiful to the eyes of humans. So then, I trained my whole Pandemic year into the rust of putting a healthy lifestyle in my routine. I proliferate and allow myself to exercise at night and in the morning. I changed the way I eat things up, consuming more dietary foods, and drinking more water for abundance. Nothing makes me realize that I should not permit my change for the others to see me beautiful. Because I am me, and this is what my purpose is. To be my own standards. The first wave of the pandemic changes me a lot, nurturing it makes my mentality stronger. Is that so? Yes, Pandemic means a lot to me. It surge my cycle to the fullest, finding that I let my family regards with my life, applying the real essence of life.</p>
